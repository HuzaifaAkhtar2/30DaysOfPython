# 30 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to my journey through 30 Days of Python! 📅

## 🚀 Overview

This repository documents my progress as I learn and practice Python for 30 consecutive days. Each day covers a new topic, and includes notes, code examples, and exercises.

## 📓 Challenge Structure

- **Each Day:** One topic, a folder named `day_##`, with source code and notes.
- **Goal:** Build consistency, deepen Python knowledge, and share progress.
